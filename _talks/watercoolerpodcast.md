In this episode of Water Cooler Talk, Adam and I talk have an informal chat about a copule of news stories about technology, including a story about ChatGPT taking jobs from those that provide essays for student essay farms.

This was a super fun chat, and I love that participation in the podcast yielded a super great sketch of me by Neil Kohney.

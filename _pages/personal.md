<img align="right" width = "100" src="/images/johnarya.jpg"> Outside of philosophy, I've collected a bunch of hobbies. Currently, I spend a lot of time learning about, making, and drinking coffee. Previously, I've spent lots of hobby time playing foosball, basketball, hiking, bouldering, and playing video games.

Outside of hobbies, I mostly like to spend time hanging out with my partner, Evelyn, and my dog, Arya. 

Eventually this space might host personal projects.

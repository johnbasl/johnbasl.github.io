[<img align="right" width = "300" src='/images/johnarya.jpg'>](/images/johnarya.jpg) Outside of philosophy, I collect hobbies and fall deeply down rabbit holes. I spend a lot of time [learning about](/images/visualizer.jpg), [making](/images/shot.jpog), and [drinking](/images/coffee.jpg coffee. My office at Northeastern serves as a coffee shop, [Normative Grounds](/images/coffeecart.jpg). If you happen to be a Decent Espresso user, you can find a link to my Visualizer shot database on the left.

In the past, I've spent lots of hobby time on foosball, basketball, lockpicking, hiking, bouldering, straight razors, and video games. I still return to almost all of these here and there (except maintaining and shaving with a straight razor). 

I also like to tinker with technology in many forms. 

Outside of hobbies, I mostly like to spend time with my partner, Evelyn, and my dog, Arya.

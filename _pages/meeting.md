Below are some links to schedule meetings with me. I try to be good about my calendar and so if a time is shown as available, that should be accurate. Apologies in advance if I end up having to change things around.

# In-Person
[30-minute Coffee Chat](https://calendly.com/johnbasl/coffee-and-chat)

# Virtual
[30-minute Virtual Meeting](https://calendly.com/johnbasl/zoom-meeting-with-john)

[1-hour Virtual Meeting](https://calendly.com/johnbasl/zoom-meeting-with-john)

Please note: if you've somehow stumbled upon this page via internet search or some other means, this is not intended as a public meeting scheduler. If you'd like to meet me but weren't directed to this page by me, please send me an email to chat about a potential meeting.
